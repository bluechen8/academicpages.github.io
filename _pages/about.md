Hello :)
My name is Boru(blue) Chen ["陈博儒"]. I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, working with [Professor Christopher Fletcher](http://cwfletcher.net/). I have broad interests in computer security. For now, my work concentrates on micro-architecture vulnerabilities.

Before coming to the corn fields, I received a B.E. degree in Automation from Zhejiang University, China.
